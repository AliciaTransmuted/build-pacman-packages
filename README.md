# build-pacman-packages

Install a list of applications using pacman, sending a summary to the terminal, and detailed results to log files

Shell script build-pacman-packages
- reads a text file containing apt packages to install,
- summarizes the entire installation process, and
- generates detailed log files 

Benefits
- lets you keep an ongoing alphabetical (highly recommended) list of useful pacman packages you can't live without
- installs each package, one at a time... that way if a particular application is missing, it doesn't hold up the rest
- handy error log lets you get right to the problem packages
- provides a simple way to rebuild your application base on a new build... just start it, watch some tv, check it later
- keeps logs of previous installation attempts

2019-06-25: Initial release
